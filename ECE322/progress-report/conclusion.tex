A very high condition coverage is our goal for this project. Even if that isn't achived through unit tests. We may also look into branch coverage of the User Interface flow. Overall we are slightly behind our original percent coverage goal due to the unforseen testability difficulties, however we feel on track to meeting our coverage goals. It is possible we may apply more black box methods of validation once the requirements of the moo-d project solidify further.
