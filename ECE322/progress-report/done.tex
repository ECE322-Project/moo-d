\subsection{Unit Tests}
Some unit tests were created in a white box testing manner.
These tests were written using JUnit.

Currently, we're testing \dots things \dots

Currently, the code coverage is \dots. We aim to reach \dots.

\subsection{UI Tests}
Automated user interface tests were created using the Espresso framework.
\url{https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso}

Currently, we have tests for the app's functionality to add a mood event.
We check each case of adding a mood event, making sure that an error 
dialog is shown if not enough information is shown, and testing the
different optional imputs. For example, we have a test for just selecting
the mood, another which does that and adds a comment. There are also tests
for adding moods where the user's location is recorded, and where the test
selects the number of people the user was hanging out with.
These tests assert that the right data is shown on the main screen
after entering the moods. For example, if the user entered `HAPPY', that
must be shown. Additionally, if the user selected `ANGRY', and entered
a comment, that comment should also be shown. If the location was entered,
then NaN should not be shown as a coordinate.
\todo{should I add a test which combines everything mentioned above?}

At the end of each test, the mood is deleted, so the delete functionality
is also covered by these tests.

The UI test for filtering moods is mostly done, but not quite yet.

\todo{maybe a screenshot would be useful for explaining??}
